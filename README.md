## Screenshots

The tool window is a native IntelliJ-platform **Swing** UI (`JBTable` + panels),
which can only be captured from a running IDE — it does not render in a headless
browser. To grab clean marketplace shots, run the sandbox IDE and screenshot the
tool window (a 2-click pass):

```bash
./gradlew runIde              # launches a sandbox IDE with the plugin
# then: View → Tool Windows → Darkmoon, click Refresh (fixtures load the
# synthetic Demo Shop campaign), and screenshot the Campaigns / Vulnerabilities
# / finding-detail / Reports tabs.
```

The plugin renders the **same synthetic Demo Shop dataset** and redaction model
as the [VS Code extension](https://github.com/ASCIT31/darkmoon-vscode#screenshots);
see that repo's Screenshots section for the equivalent views.

## What it does

- **Campaigns** tab — every campaign with target, status, overall risk and
  finding count.
- **Vulnerabilities** tab — a sortable / filterable / searchable `JBTable`
  (columns: severity, title/type, target/component, status, campaign) with a
  **finding-detail** pane (description, evidence, remediation).
- **Reports** tab — the **redaction-safe** report by default; the full,
  rehydrated report opens only on an explicit, confirmed, **local** action.
- **Refresh** and **Launch campaign** actions.
- **Secrets** (the Pro JWT) live in the IDE **PasswordSafe**, never in settings,
  logs or process arguments; PasswordSafe is only ever touched off the EDT.
- **Capability degradation** — Pro-only features (remediation → PR, live
  streaming, scheduler) are disabled on OSS and gated on the backend-reported
  capability map, not on an edition sniff.
- **Not exposed by design:** the infrastructure graph, and any automatic pull
  request. Remediation is a forwarded opt-in only; the plugin never opens a PR.

```

### Why the Kotlin client shells out (and the bridge)

The plan says *do not reimplement the TypeScript client.* Detection,
normalization and redaction live **once**, in the shipped `@darkmoon_ai/client`.
`darkmoon-client-kotlin` is therefore a **contract port plus a subprocess
adapter**: it mirrors the frozen wire types and deserializes JSON produced by the
JS client; it does not re-derive any backend behaviour. The Pro JWT is passed
only via the `DARKMOON_TOKEN` environment variable, so it never appears in a
process listing.

The foundation ships two entry points:

- **`darkmoon-ci`** — the CI-oriented binary (`detect`, `launch`, `status`,
  `summary`, `findings`, `report`, `wait`, `run`). Perfect for pipelines, but it
  has no *list all campaigns*, *single finding + evidence*, or *stream* command.
- **`@darkmoon_ai/client`** — the full library, which does expose the entire
  contract surface (verified against the real OSS data dir: 11 campaigns,
  per-campaign findings, redaction-safe by default).

A GUI needs the full read surface, so the plugin ships a tiny **bridge**
(`src/main/resources/bridge/darkmoon-bridge.mjs`) that exposes that full library
through the JSON subcommand grammar `CliDarkmoonClient` speaks. The bridge only
*calls* the library — no detection, normalization or redaction of its own — and
strips the internal `raw` object before printing. Point the plugin's
`darkmoon-ci command` setting at either the CI binary (subset of features) or
`node …/darkmoon-bridge.mjs` (full features). The subcommand grammar is
documented in the KDoc of `CliDarkmoonClient`; the JSON **shapes** are frozen.

## Build, test, verify

Requires JDK 17 and Node.js (for the conformance test double). The Gradle
wrapper fetches Gradle 9.5 and the IntelliJ Platform.

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-17
./gradlew :client:test        # Kotlin client conformance (18 tests)
./gradlew test                # plugin unit + integration tests
./gradlew verifyPlugin        # IntelliJ Plugin Verifier
./gradlew buildPlugin         # produces build/distributions/darkmoon-jetbrains-<version>.zip
./gradlew runIde              # sandbox IDE for a manual smoke test (needs a display)
```

### Conformance

`darkmoon-client-kotlin` is validated three ways against the **same** foundation
fixtures:

1. **Language-neutral goldens** (`fixtures/conformance/*.golden.json`, the
   canonical OSS==Pro==golden output) are deserialized into the frozen Kotlin
   types — proving the port is field-complete and correctly typed
   (`GoldenConformanceTest`).
2. A committed **test double** of the CLI emits contract JSON from the raw
   fixtures so `CliDarkmoonClient` is exercised over a real subprocess boundary,
   including redaction and the two-key opt-in (`ConformanceTest`, 18 cases).
3. A **real end-to-end** test drives `CliDarkmoonClient` → bridge →
   `@darkmoon_ai/client` → the real OSS data dir when they are present on the
   machine (`DarkmoonPluginTest.testRealLibraryViaBridge`; skips otherwise).

## Install (manual, fallback)

The plugin is live on the JetBrains Marketplace; use this only for a local build or an offline install.

1. `./gradlew buildPlugin`
2. In the IDE: **Settings → Plugins → ⚙ → Install Plugin from Disk…** and pick
   `build/distributions/darkmoon-jetbrains-<version>.zip`.
3. Configure under **Settings → Tools → Darkmoon** (mode, base URL,
   `darkmoon-ci` command, and — for Pro — the token).

## Publishing (maintainers)

The plugin is **published on the JetBrains Marketplace** (plugin 34497, id
`fr.ascit.darkmoon`). Updates still require human-owned credentials and decisions:

- A **JetBrains account** and the **vendor/organization profile** for ASC-IT.
- The **first upload** was done manually through the Marketplace UI; subsequent
  updates can use the automated `publishPlugin` task.
- A permanent **publishing token** (`PUBLISH_TOKEN`), and, for signed builds,
  the **signing key** material (`CERTIFICATE_CHAIN`, `PRIVATE_KEY`,
  `PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`) — all consumed from environment variables.
- The **plugin id `fr.ascit.darkmoon` is permanent** now that it is published.

## Pass/fail policy

This plugin is a browse/launch client, not a CI gate. The findings-based
pass/fail policy (`--fail-on critical,high`, exit code `2`) is computed by the
`darkmoon-ci` CLI and the CI/CD integrations (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins),
never inside the IDE.
